Creating a distributed application conforming to the CORBA standard usually consists
of the following steps:

1. Define the IDL specification
2. Compile the IDL specification to the implementation language
3. Implement the server based on the generated source code
4. Implement the client,
5. Run the ORB daemon, the server and client


The Server:

Preparing the server involves implementing the methods specified in the IDL.
IDL generate stub and skeleton code which consists of only declarations of what
will be implemented in the project, the implementation is done in the implementation
language. It is also neccessary to add the code for initializing the CORBA system and
to install the service. Uusally these actions are delegared to the main() method of some
additional class. If we use a POA adapter then it may follow as such:

1. Create and initialize the ORB,
2. Get a reference to the root POA and activate the POAManager
3. Create a server object and store a reference to it,
4. Retrieve a reference to the naming service,
5. Register the server under some name,
6. Wait for clients. 


The Client:

A client application must obtain a reference to that of the server object.
Similar to RMI (Remote Method Invocation) the server object is represented locally
by a stub. A reference to the server is retrieved via the naming service, hence
we must first access this service as in the server side. 

1. Create and initialize the ORB
2. Get a reference to the naming service
3. Get a reference to the server object by means of its name
4. Call server object methods. 

A client may invoke any methods of the server object which were declared within the IDL
interface of which the server implements.
